#### Single-line Summary
**Today, John and Ryan paired together. It took about 2hrs**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we invoked the Article.fetchAll() function to initialize our JS
  2. Next, we got the JSON data from the hackerIpsum.json file and stored it in local storage as a stringified object.
  3. Finally we passed the parsed raw data to the function if it found local storage.
